      Starting with the nose, the <span class="part" data-part="forward-fuselage">forward fuselage</span> is constructed in <span class="place">Wichita, Kansas</span>. But the <span class="part" data-part="forward-landing-gear">forward landing gear</span> underneath the cockpit is constructed in <span>Gloucester</span>… the one in the UK that is, not Massachusetts. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>

      Those <span class="part" data-part="forward-cargo-doors">forward cargo doors</span> your luggage goes through to the lower hold? Those are made by Saab in <span class="place">Linköping, Sweden</span>. The doors you enter through though? Those come from Toulouse, France. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>

      Moving aft, the <span class="part" data-part="mid-forward-fuselage">mid-forward fuselage</span> is constructed in <span class="place">Nagoya</span>, along with the <span class="part" data-part="center-wing-box">center wing box</span> directly behind it. But the <span class="part" data-part="center-fuselage">center fuselage</span> above and behind the wing box comes from the opposite side of the planet, from a small town in the bootheel of Italy called <span class="place">Grottaglie</span>. Along the side of the center wing box are pieces called <span class="part" data-part="wing-to-body-fairings">wing-to-body fairings</span>, basically the parts that link the straight wings to the round fuselage. Those-along with the <span class="part" data-part="landing-gear-doors">landing gear doors</span>-are made by Boeing, but in Winnipeg, Canada. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>
    </p>

    <p class="scroll-text" id="s4">
      The wings themselves are made up of several parts. Most of the <span class="part" data-part="wings">wing</span> is made by Mitsubishi in <span class="place">Nagoya</span>. But when taking off or coming in for landing, you may notice the edges of the wings have parts that move. The <span class="part" data-part="fixed-and-moveable-leading-edge">fixed</span> and <span class="part" data-part="fixed-and-moveable-leading-edge">moveable leading (front) edge</span> is made in <span class="place">Tulsa, Oklahoma</span> by Spirit AeroSystems. The tailing (back) edge of the wing is different. The <span class="part" data-part="moveable-trailing-edge">moveable tailing edge</span> (wing flap) is made by Boeing in Melbourne, Australia, while the <span class="part" data-part="fixed-trailing-edge">fixed tailing edge</span> is made by Kawasaki in Nagoya. Underneath the wing are supports for the  <span class="part" data-part="flap-support-fairings">flaps</span>. Those are made in Busan, South Korea by KAL-ASD, who also make the wing tips. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>
    </p>

    <p class="scroll-text" id="s5">
      Hanging down from the wings are, obviously, the engines. But the engine units are made up of separate parts themselves. The <span class="part" data-part="nacelles">nacelles</span> house the engine and connect the whole apparatus to the wing. They are produced by Goodrich in <span class="place">Chula Vista, CA</span>, just outside San Diego. Then inserted into the nacelles are the <span class="part" data-part="engines">engines</span>. Airlines don’t all use the same engines. Some choose to use General Electric engines, which are manufactured in the Cincinnati suburb of <span class="place">Evendale, Ohio</span>. Others decide to use Rolls-Royce Holdings engines (different company than the one that makes fancy cars for Her Majesty, the Queen). Rolls-Royce makes its engines in <span class="place">Derby, UK</span> in the East Midlands of England. If you’re not keeping track, just the wings and engines alone come from up to five countries on four separate continents. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>
    </p>

    <p class="scroll-text" id="s6">
      Underpinning the center fuselage and wings are the massive set of <span class="part" data-part="landing-gear">landing gear</span> and <span class="part" data-part="landing-gear">wheels</span>. Those are made in <span class="place">Gloucester, UK</span> as already stated. But their <span class="part" data-part="main-landing-gear-wheel-well">housing</span>, where they fold up during flight, is made in <span class="place">Nagoya</span>. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>
    </p>

    <p class="scroll-text" id="s7">
      Finally, we reach the tail end of the aircraft. The main portion of the <span class="part" data-part="aft-fuselage-main">aft fuselage</span> is constructed by Boeing in Charleston, SC, with the <span class="part" data-part="aft-fuselage-cone">next portion</span> of the cone coming from <span class="place">Busan, South Korea</span>. The final tip, the <span class="part" data-part="tail-cone">tail cone</span> comes from Boeing’s <span class="place">Auburn, WA</span> factory. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>
    </p>

    <p class="scroll-text" id="s8">
      Lastly are the <span class="part" data-part="">tail</span> and the <span class="part" data-part="">horizontal stabilizers</span>. The <span class="part" data-part="">tail fin</span> is built by Boeing in <span class="place">Frederickson, WA</span> but the <span class="part" data-part="">rudder</span>, the moveable part of the tail, comes from Chengdu Aircraft Industrial in <span class="place">Chengdu, China</span>. The <span class="part" data-part="horizontal-stabilizer">horizontal stabilizers</span> (the smaller aft wings) come from either two sources: <span class="place">Foggia, Italy</span> where they are made by Finmeccanica, or <span class="place">Salt Lake City, UT</span> where they are made by Boeing. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>
    </p>

    <p class="scroll-text" id="s9">
      Many pieces are constructed into larger single section offsite. For instance, the entire wing assembly (wing, tailing and leading edges, supports, etc.) is assembled into one section. Then they need to get to <span class="place">Everett, WA</span> for final assembly. For that, Boeing designed specially modified 747s with a cargo hold large enough to transport the fuselage and wings called the Boeing Dreamlifter. The Dreamlifter ferries these subsections from around the globe to the U.S., where they are assembled like a puzzle into a final, unified product: the Boeing 787. <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>
