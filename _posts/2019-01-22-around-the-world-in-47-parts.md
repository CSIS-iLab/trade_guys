The Boeing Company is synonymous with American aviation, and a symbol of US innovation, aerospace dominance, and advanced manufacturing know-how.

Since it was founded in 1916, just thirteen years after the Wright Brothers’ flight at Kitty Hawk, Boeing has been at the forefront of the aerospace industry. Today they develop commercial aircraft, fighter planes and attack helicopters, satellites and spacecraft. Boeing employs 137,000 people in all 50 states and is the nation’s single largest exporter, sending its aircraft all over the globe.

Among the most famous aircraft recently developed is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, a new type of widebody long-haul commercial airplane that is revolutionary for its use of lightweight composite materials. The 787 is manufactured at Boeing’s Everett Factory, the largest building in the world by volume, in Everett, Washington.

While the completed 787 rolls off the assembly line in Everett, large portions of the plane are not made nor even assembled in Washington State or even in the US. In fact, [35 percent](http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2003707208_787globalbuild15.html) of the 787 is built in Nagoya, Japan.

Where else do parts come from? Everywhere. At least nine countries and half a dozen states on four continents. Fasten your seatbelts and put your tray tables and seat back in the upright and locked position-let’s take a journey through the Boeing supply chain.
