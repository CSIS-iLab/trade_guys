In this episode, the Trade Guys discuss the mayhem right before the United States pulls the trigger on imposing tariffs on China. The tariffs are set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. in Washington on Friday, and the administration is slated to slap tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. The administration says they want to level the playing field, but is this good for American workers and companies? Hosted by H. Andrew Schwartz and produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
