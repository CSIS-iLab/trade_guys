In this episode, the Trade Guys welcome another special guest. Ed Brzytwa is the director of international trade at the American Chemistry Council and a former United States Trade Representative negotiator. He joins the Trade Guys in the studio to talk about how the trade war is affecting both producers and consumers of chemical productsâ€” everything from plastics, to cosmetics, to liquified natural gas. Hosted by H. Andrew Schwartz and produced by Yumi Araki at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
