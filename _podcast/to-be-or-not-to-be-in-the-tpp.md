In this inaugural episode of The Trade Guys, Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch talk about a trade deal that’s made headlines: The Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. They discuss what to make of the President’s recent announcement that the U.S. might rejoin the deal—even though he pulled out of it on his third day in office. What will it take for the U.S. to rejoin? Can it even do that? How are the other signatories proceeding? Hosted by H. Andrew Schwartz and produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
