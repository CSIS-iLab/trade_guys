introduction: Trade Guys Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch talk with H. Andrew Schwartz
  about trade in ways that everyone can understand.
the_show: "International trade is making headlines a lot these days. And news changes
  fast. A trade war with China? Bad blood between our closest allies and trading partners,
  like Canada? It’s hard to keep up.\n\nTrade experts Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch
  break down the buzz around trade. They get to the root of how it affects policy,
  and lay out how it impacts your day-to-day. Most importantly, they talk about trade
  in terms that everyone can understand.\n\n  \n_The Trade Guys_ is hosted every week
  by H. Andrew Schwartz and produced by Yumi Akari at the Center for Strategic and
  International Studies (CSIS), a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C."
